# A dotnet VERGE RPCClient
verge-dotnet-mobile is a crossplatform app built with Xamarin

It is a fork of the excellent Kapitalize Bitcoin Client (now removed from GitHub) intended for use with VERGE. The purpose of this repository is:

* Provide a one-stop resource for the dotnet developer to get started with VERGE integration.
* Prevent would-be VERGE web developers worrying whether a VERGE client will work out of the box, or have to construct their own.
* Promote dotnet development of VERGE web apps.
* Identify and address any incompatibilities with the VERGE APIs that exist now, and/or in the future.

## Dependencies

You'll need a running instance of [verged](https://github.com/vergecurrency/verge) to connect with.

## Commands

TODO: Write tests for these.
